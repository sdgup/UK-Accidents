# UK-Accidents
Exploratory Data Analysis on Accidents-Casualty-Vehicle

In this report, we are working with the UK Government data on accidents, casualties, and vehicle data published by the Department for Transport (UK gov department of transport, n.d.). The chosen data contains the last 5 years of records and the data is fairly accurate in terms of availability and consistency. After collecting the data, initially, it is analyzed for understanding, pre-processing, and cleansing. The cleaned data is used to create further visualizations and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). At the end of this report, a discussion of insights found in the data is discussed. Using Apache spark the whole datasets were managed swiftly and the underlying Hadoop storage is well capable of handling the Big data. There are 1.6 million records present in the combined dataset and by the analyses we ran through some insights obtained in this process.
